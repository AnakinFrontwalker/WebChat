*Silizard Reloaded*

All of us here share the love to RPG and online games. We decided that our old MUD project World of Silizard (WolfS) should be rewritten to accomodate new needs: modern platforms and technologies. Also it is our goal to learn how to cooperate and use tools like git and Visual Studio.

Nothing is set in stone, but so far we use:
- Nodejs
- Angular 2
- Socket.io
- Material Design Lite
