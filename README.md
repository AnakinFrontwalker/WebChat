*Silizard Reloaded*

All of us here share the love to RPG and online games. We decided that our old MUD project World of Silizard (WolfS) should be rewritten to accomodate new needs: modern platforms and technologies. Also it is our goal to learn how to cooperate and use tools like git and Visual Studio.

Nothing is set in stone, but so far we use:
- Nodejs
- Angular 2
- Socket.io
- Material Design Lite




This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.9.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/route/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
So far we don\'t have any tests, so this is here just for info.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
